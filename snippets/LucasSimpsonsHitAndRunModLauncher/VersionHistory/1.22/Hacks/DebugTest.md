### General
* Made it only check if the **H** key is down once each frame instead of once for every possible collision.
* Made it only check if the **H** key is down when the game window is focused.
* Made the vehicle controller used when possessing vehicles with the 8 key only get the key states once each frame.
    * Did you know about this feature? We didn't.
* Made possessing vehicles with the 8 key still use their old controller when not accelerating or steering, not switch them to in-car physics until accelerating or steering and take traffic cars off rails when not accelerating or steering.
    * No seriously, Lucas found out he did this recently. I wonder what other secrets there are...
    * Loren should really document Debug Test sometime.

### Graphics Page
* Added **Software Vertex Processing**.
* Added **Flip > X**, **Flip > Y**, **Flip > Z** and **Flip > Cull Mode** to flip the viewport in wacky ways.

### Vehicles Page
* Added **Air Vent Force**. Now your car can soar like a candy wrapper in an updraft.
    * This suppresses the new **Vehicles > No Air Vent Audio** feature of Bug Fixes if the force is not 0.
* Added **Override Maximum Traffic**.
* Added **No Load Properties** to disable the game loading CON files.
    * Also added **Set Up Vehicle Handling** and **Create Driver** to make the game do some initialization stuff it would've done if it loaded the CON file.
* Removed the limit of 5 on **Vehicles > Road Nodes > Maximum Cars**.

### Miscellaneous Page
* Added **Gravity** settings. Far out!
    * Screen might go blue if you set some of these numbers the wrong way. No warranty included.
* Added **Heaps > No Temp Heap**.
* Moved **Use Tracking Heaps** into the new **Heaps** group.
