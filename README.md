# DT Docs
This repository contains Markdown files and other configuration data for Donut Team's documentation website, DT Docs.

## Contributing
TODO: write contributor guidelines

## Document Front Matter
Documents contain YAML front matter declaring various attributes.

The available keys are as follows, with **required keys in bold**:

* **title** (string): The title of the document.
* **description** (string): A brief description of the document.
* authors (number[]): An array of Donut Team User IDs representing the authors of this document.

## Custom Markdown Features
While DT Docs utilizes fairly standard Markdown, there are various custom extensions implemented on top.

### Block Tokens
#### Document Snippets
You can reference a reusable block of Markdown, located within this repo's `snippets` folder, using this syntax:
```
{{ Snippet:TheSimpsonsHitAndRun/Scripting/ConsoleCommands/Scopes/CarCon.md }}
```

#### Tabs
You can add tabs, typically used to show code in multiple languages, using this syntax:
```
{{ tabs }}
{{ tab Tab 1 }}
I'm the first tab!
{{ endtab }}
{{ tab Tab 2 }}
I'm the second tab!
{{ endtab }}
{{ endtabs }}
```

Nested tabs are not supported.

#### Video
You can embed videos from either a direct URL (currently only URLs ending with .mp4 are supported):
```
!![https://donut-team.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/example.mp4]
```

Or from YouTube:
```
!![https://www.youtube.com/watch/dQw4w9WgXcQ]
```

### Inline Tokens
#### Document Reference
You can reference another document in a manner similar to MediaWiki's internal link syntax:
```
[[LucasRadMusicScriptBuilder/Intro.md]]
```

When referencing a document, the name of the document will be inserted by default. If you want some other text, use a separator bar and specify it:
```
[[LucasRadMusicScriptBuilder/Intro.md|custom link text]]
```

Paths can be relative to the document the reference is in, or absolute if they start with a /.

If used within a document snippet, the path must be absolute.

If the document does not exist, this will instead display the text "Invalid Document".

#### Donut Team User Reference
You can reference a Donut Team user by their ID as follows:
```
<@2>
```

Because user references use IDs, they will never break and they will also show the user's preferred name.

If the user disables or deletes their Donut Team account, this will instead display the text "Deleted User".

#### Mod Bakery Project Reference
You can reference a Mod Bakery project inline as follows:
```
[Project:6]
```

Because project references use IDs, they will never break and they will also show the project's current title.

If the project is not published, this will instead display the text "Unpublished Project".
