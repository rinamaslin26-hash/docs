This page documents all the command line arguments for the Mod Launcher.

# CommandLine.txt
As of Version 1.18, the Mod Launcher also supports reading command line arguments out of a file named "CommandLine.txt" placed next to its executable.

In this file, each argument and its parameters must be on a separate line. Parameters also should not have quotes around them where they normally would. The following is an example:

```text
-watermarkopacity
1.0
-testing
-font
Comic Sans MS
20
```

```

## -nohacksupportcheck

```

## -settingsloadhacks

As of Version 1.19, there is now an [[Hacks/CustomFiles/LuaFunctions/IsTesting.md]] CustomFiles Lua Function that returns true when this is enabled.

As of Version 1.22, this now shows an assert if the game is terminated but takes more than 1 second to exit. This version also adds a "Force Update Pinned Shortcuts" option to the "Open.." menu on the main window to update any pinned shortcuts to contain the Mod Launcher's [App ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/shell/appids).

```

## -noappid
**Added in Version 1.22.**

Makes it to the Mod Launcher does not specify an [App ID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/shell/appids).

This also disables the updating of Jump Lists as they work considerably better with an ID (as they're not bound to the path the program is located at).

```text
-noappid
```

## -nogameappid
**Added in Version 1.27.**

Prevents the Mod Launcher from setting an app ID on the game, as it does starting in Version 1.27.

# Conflict Checking
## -allowignoremodconflicts

```

## -noscanmodfiles
**Added in Version 1.17.**

Makes the Mod Launcher skip scanning mod files when loading mods. This drastically reduces the loading time of the Mod Launcher *however* modified dates and conflict checking between files in the CustomFiles folders of non-compiled mods will not work. The size of any such mods will also be unavailable in the Advanced tab of the mod's information. The "Show Newest File" option in the right click menu of the mod in the mods list will also not work properly.

```text
-noscanmodfiles
```

## -scanallmodfiles
**Added in Version 1.18.**

Makes the Mod Launcher scan all mod files regardless of whether or not they will compile in. This will cause the mod's modified date to potentially appear differently as well as causing its size to appear larger than it would otherwise. The "Show Newest File" option in the right click menu of the mod in the mods list may also show a different file than it would otherwise.

This was the default behaviour prior to Version 1.18.

```text

```text
-noaudiodevicecheck
```

## -noblockredundantpresent
**Added in Version 1.23.10.**

Prevents this hack from preventing the game from redundantly presenting (presenting after a previous present or a device reset/swap chain recreation and before beginning a scene) to reduce/prevent flickering when resizing.

```text
-noblockredundantpresent
```

## -noblockredundantreset
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Makes it so this hack does NOT block the game from resetting it Direct3D device when it's unnecessary.

```text
-noblockredundantreset
```

## -nohacklanguagelocalisation
**Added in Version 1.22.4.**

Makes it so hacks do not use language localisation.

Makes it so this hack does not handle the message shown when files are not found, instead showing the game's original message.

```text
-nohandlefilenotfound
```

## -nohardwareskinning
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Disables hardware skinning and instead makes the game use different code for skins.

```text
-nohardwareskinning
```

## -hardwareskinning
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Blocks hacks from disabling hardware skinning.

```text
-hardwareskinning
```

## -nohookd3d
**Added in Version 1.22.**

Disables this hack hooking Direct3D. Enabling this breaks functionality in a great many hacks. Probably don't use this.

```text
-nohookd3d
```

## -hookd3d
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Forces this hack to hook Direct3D regardless of whether any enabled hacks require it to.

```text

```text
-noreloadcarcameradata
```

## -noresourcemeta
**Added in Version 1.22.1.**

Disables Hack Support reading information out of the Meta files for Mods and Hacks.

This makes the Mod Launcher use the internal names of hacks in various places and makes Lua functions that get Meta information (such as [[Hacks/CustomFiles/LuaFunctions/GetModTitle.md]] and [[Hacks/CustomFiles/LuaFunctions/GetModVersion.md]]) return nil.

```text
-noresourcemeta
```

## -suspend
**Added in Version 1.18.2.**

Makes the Mod Launcher suspend the game before its code starts so you can attach a debugger.

As of Version 1.22 the message box now shows up earlier.

As of Version 1.23.2, using this alongside `-breakgame` will cause the message to get shown by the Mod Launcher before resuming the injection thread (instead of being shown from inside the game process).

```text
-suspend
```

# Hack: Anti-aliasing
These command line arguments affect whether or not the [[Hacks/Antialiasing.md]] Anti-aliasing hack will be displayed in the mod's list.

## -forcemsaa
**Added in Version 1.21.**

Makes the launcher show every MSAA mode in the hack's settings regardless of what is supported by your graphics card.

```text
-forcemsaa
```

## -nomsaa
**Added in Version 1.21.**

Makes the launcher skip the check for what MSAA modes are supported which disables and hides this hack from the mods list.

```text
-nomsaa
```

These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/CustomCarSupport.md]] hack is enabled.

## -nocarindexmapping
**Added in Version 1.22.**

Disables the hack dynamically re-mapping car indices to avoid conflicts between mods.

As of **Version 1.27**, this is now also respected by the Mod Launcher itself when checking for conflicts between mods.

```text
-nocarindexmapping
```

# Hack: Custom Files
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/CustomFiles/Intro.md]] hack is enabled.

## -legacyoutput
**Added in Version 1.23.9.**

Reverts the Output Lua function back to how it worked prior to Version 1.23.9.

```text
-legacyoutput
```

## -noadditionalfiles
**Added in Version 1.22.**

Disables the AdditionalFiles folder. This will probably break mods that rely on that folder.

```text
-noadditionalfiles
```

## -noenabledep
**Added in Version 1.23.10.**

Prevents this hack from enabling [Data Execution Prevention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/data-execution-prevention).

```text
-noenabledep
```

## -noluastacktrace
**Added in Version 1.23.8.**

This disables the Lua stack traces added to Lua execution errors in this version.

```text
-noluastacktrace
```

## -notruncateluafilenamestart
**Added in Version 1.23.8.**

This reverts the improvement introduced in this version where Lua errors truncate the start of the path instead of the end of it.

```text
-notruncateluafilenamestart
```

## -slowgameload
**Added in Version 1.22.**

Makes the game wait the specified amount of milliseconds for each byte of any file the game reads to artificially increase load times.

```text
-slowgameload 1000
```

# Hack: Custom Vertex Shader Support
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/CustomVertexShaderSupport.md]] hack is enabled.

## -createcustomvertexshadersondevicereset
**Added in Version 1.23.4.**

This makes it so custom vertex shaders are created when the graphics device is created or reset.

```text
-createcustomvertexshadersondevicereset
```

# Hack: Debug Checks
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/DebugChecks.md]] hack is enabled.

## -novehiclepositionalsoundplayercarnullcheckasserts
**Added in Version 1.23.6.**

Disables the assert added in this version.

```

## -noqueryd3d9
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Prevents other hacks from accessing or knowing they're running in Direct3D 9.

```text
-noqueryd3d9
```

# Hack: Discord Rich Presence
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/DiscordRichPresence.md]] hack is enabled.

## -discordloadinitialise
**Added in Version 1.23.10.**

Makes the hack initialise Discord RPC / GameSDK as soon as the hack loads. This used to be the default behaviour prior to Version 1.22 but it often causes rich presence to not work because Discord handles this poorly.

```text
-discordloadinitialise
```

## -discordrpc
**Added in Version 1.23.10.**

Forces this hack to use Discord RPC even if a Discord GameSDK DLL exists in the DLLs folder.

```text
-discordrpc
```

## -nodiscordregistercommand
**Added in Version 1.23.10.**

Prevents this hack from telling Discord the command to start the Mod Launcher.

```text
-nodiscordregistercommand
```

## -nodiscordrichpresence
**Added in Version 1.23.8.**

These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/LensFlare.md]] hack is enabled.

## -debugvisibilitytest
**Added in Version 1.19.**

Makes the hack render the Visibility Test mesh instead of the actual lens flare.

```text
-debugvisibilitytest
```

## -deactivatedworldspherelensflares
**Added in Version 1.20.**

Makes Lens Flares inside deactivated World Spheres get enqueued anyways.

```text
-deactivatedworldspherelensflares
```

## -noalpharendertarget
**Added in Version 1.19.**

Makes the hack use a render target that doesn't have an alpha channel. This is noticeable when using `-debugscreenshots`.

```text
-noalpharendertarget
```

## -noocclusion
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Makes it so the hack does not use a occlusion query when the Direct3D 9 hack is enabled.

```text
-noocclusion
```

## -occlusionsleep
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Forces the hack to wait 1 millisecond while waiting for occlusion.

```text
-occlusionsleep
```

# Hack: Load Manager Thread Coordination
These command line arguments affect the [[Hacks/LoadManagerThreadCoordination.md]] hack.

## -radloadmanagermultiplecallbacks
**Added in Version 1.23.2.**

```
-radloadmanagermultiplecallbacks
```

## -radloadmanagerthreadcoordinationimposeframelimit
**Added in Version 1.23.2.**

TODO

As of Version 1.23.9, this argument causes the hack to get loaded even if its not enabled in the mods list or required by another hack.

```
-radloadmanagerthreadcoordinationimposeframelimit
```

# Hack: Modern Computer Support
These command line arguments affect the [[Hacks/ModernComputerSupport.md]] hack.

## -allowzerodeltatime
**Added in Version 1.21.**

Allows the game to exceed 1000 FPS which can cause the delta time to be 0 which can result in the player's position becoming NaN among other issues.

```text
-allowzerodeltatime
```

## -noslowfileloadfixes
**Added in Version 1.25.**

Disables this hack's fixes for slow file loading on Windows Vista / Windows Server 2003 or newer and Wine.

```text
-noslowfileloadfixes
```

## -forceslowfileloadfixes
**Added in Version 1.25.**

Forces this hack's fixes for slow file loading to be enabled.

```text
-forceslowfileloadfixes
```

## -nononenglishwindowsmousebuttonfix
**Added in Version 1.26.**

Disables a fix added in Version 1.26 that addresses an issue in the original game where you can not bind mouse buttons when using a non-English Windows language.

```text
-nononenglishwindowsmousebuttonfix
```

## -noproperclientareacursorcentringandclipping
**Added in Version 1.26.1.**

Disables fixes for an issue where the game incorrectly centered the cursor to the window instead of it's client area *and* an issue where the game assumes the non-client area was 30 pixels at the top and 10 pixels at the other edges when clipping the cursor.

```text
-noproperclientareacursorcentringandclipping
```

# Hack: Modern Resolution Support
These command line arguments affect the [[Hacks/ModernResolutionSupport.md]] hack.

## -noenumresolutions

**Added in Version 1.23.2.**

This stops the Mod Launcher and the hack from getting resolutions from your graphics card.

```text
-noenumresolutions
```

# Hack: NVIDIA Highlights
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/NVIDIAHighlights.md]] hack is enabled.

## -nocrashhighlight
**Added in Version 1.23.6.**

Completely disables the type of highlight used when the game crashes.

```text
-nocrashhighlight
```

# Hack: Refraction Shader Support
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/RefractionShaderSupport.md]] hack is enabled.

## -refractionmultiplier
**Added in Version 1.23.4.**

Sets a multiplier for the `REFI` parameter on `refract` shaders. This affects how displaced the capture of the screen used in the refraction effect is.

```text
-refractionmultiplier MULTIPLIER
```

## -testrefraction
**Added in Version 1.23.4.**

Makes `refract` shaders always 100% refractive by forcing their `REFB` shader parameters to `1`.

```text
-testrefraction
```

# Hack: Resizable Window
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/ResizableWindow.md]] hack is enabled.

## -allowzerowindowsize
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Allows you to resize the client area of the game below 1 pixel on the width or height.

```text
-allowzerowindowsize
```

## -nomaintainwindowcentre
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Prevents this hack from trying to maintain the centre point of the game window when the game resizes it.

```text
-nomaintainwindowcentre
```

# Hack: Screenshots
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/Screenshots.md]] hack is enabled.

## -continuousscreenshots

Makes it so holding the F12 key will rapidly take screenshots.

This was the default behaviour prior to 1.22.

```text
-continuousscreenshots
```

## -debugscreenshots
**Added in Version 1.19.**

Makes the hack save multiple screenshots of a single frame with various differences.

```text
-debugscreenshots
```

# Hack: Sphere Maps
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/SphereMaps.md]] hack is enabled.

This makes slight tweaks to how the sphere map PDDI shader added by this hack works to make it more like the Xbox version of the game.

```text
-xboxspheremaps
```

# Hack: XInput
These command line arguments only take effect when the [[Hacks/XInput.md]] hack is enabled.

## -ignorepacketnumber
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Makes the hack ignore whether or not the state packet number changed.

```text
-ignorepacketnumber
```

## -nogetstateex
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Makes the hack use [XInputGetState](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/xinput/nf-xinput-xinputgetstate) function instead of a similar undocumented function. Using this argument will prevent you from mapping controls to the Guide button.

```text
-nogetstateex
```

## -noxinput
**Added in Version 1.23.1.**
	
This makes it so the hack does not make the game use XInput. 

Despite this seeming counter-intuitive, it would still allow the other features of the hack to work while Windows' XInput-to-DirectInput backwards compatibility handles inputs.

```text
-noxinput
```

## -noxinputdisable
**Added in Version 1.23.1.**

Makes it so XInput does not get disabled when the window is defocused.

```text
-noxinputdisable
```

## -noxinputenable
**Added in Version 1.23.**

Makes it so the hack doesn't call [XInputEnable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/desktop/api/xinput/nf-xinput-xinputenable) if it's available. Instead it will use a function that replicates its functionality (the same one used by default when the function isn't available).

```text
-noxinputenable
```
