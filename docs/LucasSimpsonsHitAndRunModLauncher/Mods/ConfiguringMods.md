This page has detailed documentation on ways to configure mods.

# Structure
These are the various files and folders you can expect to see in the root folder of a mod.

## Meta.ini
This file is the main configuration file for mods. It defines the meta information for the mod, what hacks it requires, who made it and more.

This file must exist and at least contain a `[Miscellaneous]` section to be considered valid. We also strongly recommend that you also at least specify a `Title` and `InternalName` within it.

## Hack Configuration Files
Some Mod Requirable hacks can have or require configuration files in the root of the mod. These can either be `.ini` files or `.xml` files depending on the hack.

## Lua Files
The [[../Hacks/CustomFiles/Intro.md|Custom Files]] hack can have a `CustomFiles.lua` file located in the root of a mod folder.

## Hack Folders
Some Mod Requirable hacks hacks can also utilise folders for their configuration files or resources:

* [[../Hacks/CustomFiles/Intro.md|Custom Files]]
* [[../Hacks/CustomText.md]]

## Icon.png / Icons Folder
Mods can provide icons for the Mod Launcher to use. This can be done as a single 256x256 `Icon.png` file in the root of the mod or as a folder named `Icons` containing any of the following files:

* `16.png`
* `24.png`
* `32.png`
* `48.png`
* `64.png`
* `256.png`

# Configuring Mods
These are all of the available configuration options for mods.
   
These should go in the mod's `Meta.ini`.
