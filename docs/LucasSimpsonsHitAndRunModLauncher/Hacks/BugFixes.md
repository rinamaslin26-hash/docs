This hack contains a variety of bug fixes for issues in the original game.

**NOTE:** When this hack is required by a mod, the mods settings for it are prioritised over the ones in the hack's settings.

# Settings
## Visual
### Cursor Position
Fixes an issue where the cursor is positioned incorrectly when using an aspect ratio other than 1:1.

### Steering Animations
Fixes an issue preventing steering/swaying animations from playing.

### Character Rotations
Fixes issues where character rotations are handled incorrectly when standing on top of movable objects such as platforms or cars.

### HUD Coin Depth
Makes the coin on the HUD have depth.

### Stuck Brake and Reverse Lights
Fixes some issues where the brake and reverse lights could get stuck on cars.

## Crashes
### Main Menu Cheat Code Enter Crash
Fixes a crash when entering a cheat code on the main menu.

### Unlock All Camera Settings Crash
Fixes a crash related to the Unlock All Cameras cheat and the Settings menu.

### Late Focus Freeze
Fixes the game freezing on the license screen if it's not focused soon enough.

### Zone Load on Exit
**This setting is only available when using the `-testing` [[../CommandLineArguments.md|command line argument]].**
	
Fixes the game crashing if it tries loading a zone on exit.

### Car Deleted While Loading CON File
**This setting is only available when using the `-testing` [[../CommandLineArguments.md|command line argument]].**

Fixes the game crashing if a car is deleted while its CON file is still loading.

### High Coin Count
**This setting is only available when using the `-testing` [[../CommandLineArguments.md|command line argument]].**

Fixes the game crashing if you collect more than 9,999,999 coins.

## Actors
### Restore Wasp Collision
Fixes an issue where Wasp Collision becomes disabled entirely (until the level is reloaded) after destroying some amount of wasp cameras resulting in cars being unable to destroy them.

## Vehicles
### No Air Vent Audio
Fixes an issue where air vent audio still plays when driving into a vent when inside a car.

### Baby Van Tilt/Wonky Driving
Fixes a famous bug that most notably causes the baby van in Level 5 Mission 3 to be tilted and have incorrect physics. 

This bug as well as this fix both apply to other cars as well though it appears most prominently on this one so it's named after it.

### Phone Booth Camera Pan Active Camera Change
This fixes a bug related to pressing the in-car change camera button during the phonebooth's camera pan. Without this bug fix, doing so will cancel the camera and switch your camera to the mouse controlled camera until the game changes your camera again (such as when getting in a car). If you use mission select to select a mission without getting in a car, you will be able to skip the next mission start camera.

## Behaviour
### Time Skip
Fixes an issue where grabbing the window header causes halts the Windows event loop for the game until it is released, causing a large delta time that causes physics issues.

This fix gives the game a delta time of 100ms instead of the real delta time in this scenario to prevent these issues.
