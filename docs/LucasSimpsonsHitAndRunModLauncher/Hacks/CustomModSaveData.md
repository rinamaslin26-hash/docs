This hack allows mods to save and load custom values to the player's save data via various other hacks, such as [[CustomFiles/Intro.md]].

# Debug Text Mode
This hack registers a debug mode for the [[DebugText.md]] hack for each enabled mod when used alongside it.

These debug modes show the values in the current save file for each mod.
