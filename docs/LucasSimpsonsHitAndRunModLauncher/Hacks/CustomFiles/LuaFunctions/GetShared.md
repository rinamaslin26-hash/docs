Returns a table that is shared by all mods.

# Syntax
```lua
GetShared()
```

# Examples
Store something in the table in one mod:
```lua
local SharedTable = GetShared()

SharedTable.Example = "Potato"
```

And then print it from another mod afterwards:
```lua
local SharedTable = GetShared()

print(SharedTable.Example) -- prints "Potato"
```
