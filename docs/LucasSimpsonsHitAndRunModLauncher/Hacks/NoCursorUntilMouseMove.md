This hack makes it so your mouse cursor is hidden on menus until you move it.

# Settings
## Tolerance
This allows you to customise the amount of movement required on either axis for the cursor to appear.

Setting this to 0 means any movement will cause the cursor to appear.

Setting this to -1 means any mouse event will cause the cursor to appear even if the cursor's position doesn't change. This is the old behaviour prior to Version 1.23.

**Defaults to 5.**
