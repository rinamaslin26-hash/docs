# Notes
* This command is not intended for use on the player's car. Doing so will cause it to apply to the car until it is deleted (even if the mission has already ended).
* There are currently complications with using this on a vehicle whose driver was added with the [[/TheSimpsonsHitAndRun/Scripting/ConsoleCommands/AddDriver.md]] command.
