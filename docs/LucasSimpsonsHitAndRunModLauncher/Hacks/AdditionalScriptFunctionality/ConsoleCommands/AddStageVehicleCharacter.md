Add a character to a stage vehicle or the player's car for a stage.

# Scope
{{ Snippet:TheSimpsonsHitAndRun/Scripting/ConsoleCommands/Scopes/MissionInitStage.md }}

# Syntax
{{ tabs }}
{{ tab MFK }}
```js
AddStageVehicleCharacter( car, character, [joint, rotation] );
```
{{ endtab }}
{{ tab Lua }}
```lua
Game.AddStageVehicleCharacter( car, character, [joint, rotation] )
```
{{ endtab }}
{{ endtabs }}

* **car**: The name of the car to add the character to.
* **current**: The player's current car.
* **character**: The name of the character to add.
* **joint**: The name of the joint to place the character on. 
    * Defaults to **pl**.
    * If the joint does not exist, the character will not be added to the car and any subsequent commands related to them will be ignored.
* **rotation**: The rotation of the character on the joint. 
    * Defaults to 180.
    * 180 is facing forwards in the car since characters are backwards in this game.

```js    
AddStage();
	// Add Marge to the Passenger Seat of the Player's Car
	AddStageVehicleCharacter("current", "marge");

	// Add Lisa and Bart to "cVan"
	//	(you'd probably want to add custom joints to the car for multiple passengers)	
	AddStageVehicle("cVan", "m1_cVan", "NULL");
	AddStageVehicleCharacter("cVan", "lisa");
	AddStageVehicleCharacter("cVan", "bart", "sl", 0);	// Bart uses the smoke location in this example.

	AddObjective("dummy");

	CloseObjective();
CloseStage();
```
