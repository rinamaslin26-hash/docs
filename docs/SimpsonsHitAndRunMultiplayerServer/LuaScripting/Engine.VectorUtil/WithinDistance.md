# Syntax
```lua
Engine.VectorUtil.WithinDistance( pointA, pointB, distance )
```

## Arguments
* **pointA** ([[../Engine.Vector3.md|Vector3]]): The first point.
* **pointB** ([[../Engine.Vector3.md|Vector3]]): The second point.
* **distance** (number): The distance to check against.

## Return Values
* (boolean): True if the distance between the two points is less than or equal to the specified distance, false otherwise.

# Examples
```lua
local pointA = Engine.Vector3(1, 2, 3)
local pointB = Engine.Vector3(4, 5, 6)
local distance = 5
local withinDistance = Engine.VectorUtil.WithinDistance(pointA, pointB, distance)
```
